            <h4>
                Do you have a date for the reception?
            </h4>
            <div>
                Not right now. There are still too many unknowns, and since we
                aren't currently committed to any vendors, we think it makes
                sense to wait until things are more certain before picking a
                date and making reservations.
                <br /><br /><br />
            </div>
            <h4>
                Will I be invited to the ceremony?
            </h4>
            <div>
                While we would love to have a fully-packed church, it's unclear
                whether it will be safe to do so. Depending on local
                restrictions on gathering sizes at that time, we may need to
                restrict attendance to a small number of people. We will let you
                know as the date approaches.
                <br /><br /><br />
            </div>
            <h4>
                Do I need to travel to Pittsburgh twice?
            </h4>
            <div>
                No. We do not want to put any burden on guests to make an extra
                trip or put anyone at risk. We hope to be able to live stream
                our ceremony so that you can watch from home!
                <br /><br /><br />
            </div>

            <h4>
                Why aren't you just waiting to have the ceremony and the
                reception on the same day?
            </h4>
            <div>
                At this time, it's unclear how long we would have to wait, and
                we don't want to delay starting our lives together.
