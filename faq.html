            <h4>Can I attend the ceremony in person?</h4>
            <div>
                Unfortunately, due to the current wave of covid cases, we've made the difficult decision to ask that ALL guests attend via our <a href="/livestream.html">livestream</a>.  Only our parents and wedding party will attend in person
                <br /><br /><br />
            </div>
            <h4>Do I need to RSVP?</h4>
            <div>
                No, we are not collecting formal RSVPs for the ceremony.<br /><br /><br />
            </div>
            <!-- <h4>What will it be like inside the Church?</h4>
            <div>
                Sacred Heart is a large Church and we will be at less than 25%
                capacity with space for distance between family units.  We could,
                however, forsee having over 100 people in attendence.  All
                guests will be required to wear masks in the pews. 
                <br /><br /><br />
            </div>

            <h4>Is there parking at the Church?</h4>
            <div>
                There is a small parking lot at the
                <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B027'25.4%22N+79%C2%B055'22.0%22W/@40.4563454,-79.9241289,280"

            <h4>Do you have a date for the reception?</h4>
            <div>
                Not right now. There are still too many unknowns, and since we
                aren't currently committed to any vendors, we think it makes
                sense to wait until things are more certain before picking a date and securing a venue.
                <br /><br /><br />
            </div>

            <h4>
                Why aren't you just waiting to have the ceremony and the
                reception on the same day?
            </h4>
            <div>
                At this time, it's unclear how long we would have to wait, and
                we don't want to delay starting our lives together.
